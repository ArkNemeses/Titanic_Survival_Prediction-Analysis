# Titanic_Survival_Prediction-Analysis
The project here is a combination of Machine Learning as well as Power BI. We are provided with the training dataset which comprises of various attributes like name, gender, age, family members, etc. of the people who boarded the Titanic and if they survived or not. Using Power BI we analyse and further create an in-depth report from the data present. Then, including the testing and Gender Submission data set, we build a model using Machine Learning to predict the chance of survival of the passengers in the testing data set. Our main aim is to select the algorithm that provides maximum accuracy while avoiding overfitting.
