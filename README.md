# Titanic_Survival_Prediction-Analysis
The project here is a combination of Machine Learning as well as Power BI. We are provided with the training dataset which we Analyse, and further create an in-depth report. 
Then, including testing and Gender Submission data set, we build a model using Machine Learning to predict the survival of the passengers in the testing data set. Our main aim is to select the algorithm that provides maximum accuracy while avoiding overfitting.
